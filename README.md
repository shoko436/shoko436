### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is [Esteban Cruz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/estebancruz/) Iâ€™m currently working as Senior Software Engineer in Backend at [Kueski](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kueski/) a recognized mexican fintech.

I've been a software engineer since 2008 when a teacher from university recommended me to a friend of him. The first 10 years of coding were with .Net Framework and C# and since I started to work in Kueski I do code in **Ruby**. I like to learn new thing and I'm focused on to be better every day and Iâ€™m currently learning **Python** and how to implement **Event Driven Solutions**

Soon I will be posting some articles about coding...
